- Promises are nothing new or revolutionary. Other languages have had them for a while. 
- But in my opinion they are important for the Javascript ecosystem
- They are a path to a better future for the language 
- You should use them
- This talk will cover mostly tips and tricks and include lots of code
- I would not consider myself an expert or authority. I have not implemented my own Promise library. These are just lessons learned from a user.

- Promises have been in browser and Node for 2 years, yet I think there still seems to be this aversion or at least lack of will to adopt them and use them.
- Bluebird and Q still popular Promise libraries, which just leads to fragmantation, which will only cause problems in future
- Express still order of magnitude more popular than Koa, the Promise-based spiritual successor to Express.
- This is due partly to technical reasons. Node core API is callback-based because maps nicely to underlying v8 platform, and so since it's the root API that everyone has to use, the paradigm carries through into the user land.
- But Promise-based Node will come eventually.
- Similarly `XHR` and ajax is event / callback based, and `fetch()` adoption lagging
- Technical and comminity issues
